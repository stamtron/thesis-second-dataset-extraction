# Video-Classification-Scripts

This repo contains the work completed for the Second Technical Chapter of my PhD. 
Three different methods of video classification are examined (ResNet3d, ResNet-LSTM, ResNet50-RL).
Two submodules of other repos are included here. The conda environment is also included for cloning purposes.
Each folder contains different scripts made for the different steps of the project.

* **data_visualization_and_augmentations:** Scripts for temporal and spatial augmenations and dataloader

* **data-statistics-split-stratification:** Scripts for Statistical Analysis of data.

* **frame_sequences_extraction:** Scripts for extracting frames for the 5 events of interest.

* **helpers_models:** Functions for loading and training the different models
